input: cipherText with length n
output: key with length m or error if no key found

bruteForce(cipherText):
    initialize empty key, distances = 0
    for textlengths 3 to 5:
        if cipherText.substring == textlength
        distances. add (index of substring - index of textlength)

    for each distance:
        get factors list
    
    for each factor:
        split cipherText into num(factor) substrings
        for each substring:
            find letter frequencies of decrypted substring
            avg index of correlation = 1 /(N)(N-1) * sum(ni(ni -1))
        
    keylength = factor with closest index of correlation to 0.067

    build key combinations for keylength

    for each key:
        find index of correlation of decrypted text with key
        calculate avg index of correlation
        possiblekey = key with closest match to 0.067 index of correlation
    
    return possibleKey
