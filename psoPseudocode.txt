input: cipherText with length n
output: key with length m or error if no key found

pso(cipherText):
    initialize 100 particles with random positions and personal best errors
    for iterations 0 to 300:
        for each particle:
            for each letter from A to Z:
                calculate fitnesserror for the particle
                update personalBest and globalBest
        for each particle:
            update velocity
            update position
    return key = globalBest


Big-O:
    initialization takes O(n) time where num particles = n
    if numiterations = k, num particales = n, keylength = m then
        fitnessfunction takes O(k*n*m) time


    Thus big-O is O(n*m*k)
