input: cipherText with length n
output: key with length m or error if no key found

pso(cipherText):
    initialize 100 particles with random positions and personal best errors
    for iterations 0 to 300:
        for each particle:
            for each letter from A to Z:
                calculate fitnesserror for the particle
                update personalBest and globalBest
        for each particle:
            update velocity
            update position
    return key = globalBest
